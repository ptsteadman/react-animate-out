# Contributing

We're glad you're considering contributing to animate-out!  Below are some tips and a brief guide.

1.  Fork and clone the repo:
  git clone git@github.com:your-username/KeyStack.git

2.  Follow the steps in the ReadMe to set up your machine.

3.  In the terminal, run:
  npm install

4.  Run the test suite:
  npm test

5.  Make your changes and write tests for your changes.

6.  Run the test suite and ensure that all of them pass:
  npm test

7.  Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

We'll respond to you as soon as we can either by merging your request and/or by giving you feedback and suggestions on your PR

Things we'll look for before pulling in your work:
  * have you tested your work well enough that another contributor is unlikely to accidentally break it?
  * is your formatting and style consistent with the rest of the project? (style guide to come)
  * have you included a brief, but informative commit message?

There is no code of conduct for contributing, but as a general rule, be nice.  :)

Happy Coding!
